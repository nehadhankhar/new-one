          <p>NASA's impact on society cannot be overstated. From developing technologies that have improved our daily lives, to inspiring generations of young people to pursue careers in science and engineering, NASA has had an immeasurable impact on our world.
            One of the most significant ways in which NASA has impacted society is through the development of new technologies. NASA's research has led to innovations in fields such as medicine, transportation, and energy. For example, NASA's work on space suits has led to the development of more advanced prosthetic limbs for amputees. Additionally, NASA's research on aerodynamics has led to more fuel-efficient cars and airplanes, reducing our carbon footprint and improving our environment.

                  <h2>Hubble Space Telescope</h2>
                <p>The Hubble Space Telescope is one of the most remarkable achievements in human history. It has allowed us to peer deep into the cosmos, revealing breathtaking images of distant galaxies, nebulas, and other celestial objects.
                  Since its launch in 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope has revolutionized our understanding of the universe and inspired a new generation of scientists and explorers. Its discoveries have challenged our assumptions about the nature of space and time, and opened up new avenues of inquiry that continue to shape our understanding of the cosmos.

                  <h2>James Webb Space Telescope</h2>
                <p>The James Telescope, also known as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), is a large, infrared telescope that is set to launch in 2021. The mission of the James Telescope is to study the universe's first galaxies and stars, as well as to search for signs of life on planets outside our solar system. 
                  The James Telescope is a collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). The telescope is named after James E. Webb, who served as the second administrator of NASA from 1961 to 1968.

                  <h2>Parker Solar Probe</h2>
                <p>The Parkes Solar Probe mission has three primary objectives that will help us better understand our closest star, the Sun. First, the mission aims to study the Sun's outer atmosphere, also known as the corona, in unprecedented detail. By doing so, scientists hope to gain a better understanding of the processes that heat the corona to millions of degrees Celsius, which is much hotter than the Sun's surface.
                  Second, the mission will investigate the solar wind, which is a stream of charged particles that flows from the Sun and affects Earth's magnetic field and radiation environment. By studying the solar wind, scientists hope to improve our ability to predict space weather and mitigate its effects on Earth and our technology.
                  Finally, the mission will explore the Sun's magnetic field and how it drives the dynamics of the corona and solar wind. This information will help us better understand the fundamental physics of our star and its impact on our planet.
